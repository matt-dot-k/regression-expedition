# An exploration of statistical learning methods in the regression context

This repository serves as a hub for an independent project. Following the conclusion of
my statistical learning class in December 2022, I figured it'd be a good idea to undertake
a small project to apply concepts highlighted in the course.

The scope of the project revolves around regression, with particular emphasis being put
on the following methods:

* Linear Regression
* Spline Regression
* Kernel Regression
* Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
